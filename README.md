## 👋 Hi, I'm Sam
I’ve worked across software engineering and award-winning machine learning research, always looking for ways to learn, improve, and build better systems.
My curiosity keeps me learning daily, pushing me to question assumptions, dig into problems, and engineer more thoughtful solutions.
I thrive in environments that value exploration, collaboration, and continuous learning.
